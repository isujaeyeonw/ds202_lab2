Part 1.<br />
Based on the histogram, ratings are fairly left skewed resulting in higher than average ratings for the chocolates, there are though a couple outliers around the 'one' rating.
```{r}
boxplot(choco$Rating, main="Boxplot of Chocolate Ratings")
hist(choco$Rating, breaks = 10, main="Histogram of Chocolate Ratings", xlab="Rating", ylab="Occurance")
```

Part 2.<br />
```{r}
barplot(choco$Date, choco$Rating)
